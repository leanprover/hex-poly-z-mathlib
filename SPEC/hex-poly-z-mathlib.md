# hex-poly-z-mathlib (depends on hex-poly-z + hex-poly-mathlib + Mathlib)

Proves `DensePoly Int ≃+* Polynomial ℤ`, the Mignotte bound, and the
Mathlib-side analytic polynomial inequalities over `Polynomial ℂ` that
downstream integer-polynomial factorization needs.

**Mignotte bound, proof strategy.**

Statement (needs `hf : f ≠ 0`; false otherwise since every polynomial
divides 0):

```lean
theorem mignotte_bound (f g : Polynomial ℤ) (hf : f ≠ 0) (hg : g ∣ f) (j : ℕ) :
    (Int.natAbs (g.coeff j) : ℝ) ≤ Nat.choose g.natDegree j * l2norm f
```

where `l2norm f := Real.sqrt (∑ i in f.support, (f.coeff i : ℝ) ^ 2)`.
The principal theorem is over `ℝ` (matching Mathlib's Mahler measure API).
An integer-facing corollary can extract `|g.coeff j| ≤ ⌊...⌋₊` if
needed by downstream code.

**Mathlib API.** All heavy analysis is in
`Mathlib.Analysis.Polynomial.MahlerMeasure`.
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/37349 added:

- `mahlerMeasure_le_sqrt_sum_sq_norm_coeff` (Landau's inequality)
- `le_mahlerMeasure_mul_right` (monotonicity)
- `norm_coeff_le_choose_mul_mahlerMeasure_of_one_le_mahlerMeasure`
  (Mignotte bound)

The earlier Mahler measure library (by Fabrizio Barroero) provides:

- `mahlerMeasure_mul`: `M(p * q) = M(p) * M(q)`
- `norm_coeff_le_choose_mul_mahlerMeasure`: `‖p.coeff n‖ ≤ C(deg, n) * M(p)`
- `one_le_prod_max_one_norm_roots`: `∏ max(1, ‖αᵢ‖) ≥ 1`

**Proof outline and glue steps.**

1. **Cast to `ℂ[X]`.** Define `F G H : Polynomial ℂ` via
   `Polynomial.map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)`. From `hg`, obtain
   `h : Polynomial ℤ` with `f = g * h`; map to `F = G * H`
   via `Polynomial.map_mul`.

2. **Nonzero factors.** From `hf` and `f = g * h`, since
   `Polynomial ℤ` is a domain, get `g ≠ 0` and `h ≠ 0`. Then
   `H ≠ 0` (and `G ≠ 0`) by injectivity of `Int.castRingHom ℂ`
   (via `Polynomial.map_ne_zero_of_injective` or `map_injective`).

3. **Mahler measure ≥ 1 for integer polynomials.** `H ≠ 0` alone
   is not enough (`(1/2 : ℂ[X])` has Mahler measure `1/2`). The
   key is that `h` has integer coefficients: `leadingCoeff h` is
   a nonzero integer, so `‖leadingCoeff H‖ ≥ 1`. Combined with
   `one_le_prod_max_one_norm_roots` and
   `mahlerMeasure_eq_leadingCoeff_mul_prod_roots`, this gives
   `1 ≤ H.mahlerMeasure`.

4. **Monotonicity.** Apply `le_mahlerMeasure_mul_right` (or use
   `mahlerMeasure_mul` + `1 ≤ H.mahlerMeasure`) to get
   `G.mahlerMeasure ≤ F.mahlerMeasure`.

5. **Coefficient bound.** Apply
   `norm_coeff_le_choose_mul_mahlerMeasure` to `G`:
   `‖G.coeff j‖ ≤ C(G.natDegree, j) * G.mahlerMeasure`.
   Chain with step 4 to get `≤ C(G.natDegree, j) * F.mahlerMeasure`.

6. **Landau bound.** Apply `mahlerMeasure_le_sqrt_sum_sq_norm_coeff`
   to bound `F.mahlerMeasure ≤ √(∑ ‖F.coeff i‖²)`.

7. **Transport back to `ℤ`.** Four lemmas:
   - **Coefficients:** `G.coeff j = ↑(g.coeff j)`, by
     `Polynomial.coeff_map`.
   - **Degree:** `G.natDegree = g.natDegree`, by
     `Polynomial.natDegree_map_of_injective` (injective cast).
   - **Support:** `F.support = f.support`, by
     `Polynomial.support_map_of_injective` (injective cast).
     Needed to rewrite the L2 sum from `F`'s support to `f`'s.
   - **Norms:** `‖((g.coeff j : ℤ) : ℂ)‖ = |(g.coeff j : ℝ)|`,
     via `Complex.norm_intCast` or `Complex.norm_ofReal` +
     `Int.cast_abs`. The L2 sum rewrites similarly since
     `‖((f.coeff i : ℤ) : ℂ)‖² = (f.coeff i : ℝ)²`. The final
     LHS rewrites from `‖...‖` to `(Int.natAbs (g.coeff j) : ℝ)`
     to match the theorem statement.

**Open Mathlib PR:** https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33463
("Mahler Measure for other rings") extends the Mahler measure definition
beyond `ℂ[X]`. If this lands, the `ℤ → ℂ` coercion step becomes cleaner.

**Robinson-form derivative surface (CLD Φ Mahler bound).**

The analytic input for the BHKS van Hoeij CLD `Φ` coefficient bound belongs in
`hex-poly-z-mathlib`, not in the Mathlib-free `hex-poly-z` library. It is a
collection of theorems about roots of complex polynomials that uses Mathlib's
complex polynomial root and Mahler-measure APIs.

This library owns the Robinson-reflection root-deletion surface in
`HexPolyZMathlib/RobinsonForm.lean`. The Robinson form keeps roots in the
closed unit disk as `X - C α` and reflects exterior roots to
`1 - C (conj α) * X`; the derivative is expanded as a sum of root-deletion
summands whose Mahler measures are individually controlled:

- The root-deletion derivative summand `Polynomial.rootDeletionDerivativeSummand g α`
  and the derivative expansion
  `Polynomial.derivative_eq_sum_rootDeletionDerivativeSummand`.
- The per-summand Mahler-measure bound
  `Polynomial.mahlerMeasure_rootDeletionDerivativeSummand_le`.

`HexBerlekampZassenhausMathlib/CLDColumnBound.lean` consumes this surface to
discharge the `hphi_mahler` hypothesis of `abs_phi_coeff_le`, the replacement
analytic obligation for the BHKS CLD `Φ` Mahler-measure bound.

Downstream libraries may depend on these theorems as Mathlib-side analytic
inputs. Mathlib-free libraries must not import this surface directly; they
should consume executable bounds or conditional hypotheses whose proofs are
discharged here.

**Shared root-separation foundations.** The generic parts of the Mahler
root-separation development live here once for both roots companions:

- `HexPolyZMathlib/Squarefree.lean` identifies the executable rational-gcd
  test with squarefreeness of the rational cast, for nonzero inputs.
- `HexPolyZMathlib/Discriminant.lean` proves the root-product form of
  `Polynomial.discr`, its nonvanishing for separable polynomials, base-change
  compatibility, and the integer lower bound `1 ≤ |discr f|`.
- `HexPolyZMathlib/Hadamard.lean` proves the sharp column-norm determinant
  inequality `Matrix.norm_det_le_prod_norm_column` over an `RCLike` field.
- `HexPolyZMathlib/MahlerSeparation.lean` proves the generic complex
  Vandermonde column bounds and identifies the discriminant root product with
  the squared Vandermonde norm. Its separable theorem supplies the sharp
  discriminant argument; `one_le_mahlerDist` extends the public separation
  inequality to every nonzero integral polynomial by applying that theorem to
  the integral radical. The radical preserves the distinct roots while having
  no larger degree or Mahler measure.

Both modules are stated at ordinary Mathlib generality and import no executable
root-isolation library. Companion-specific precision arithmetic remains in the
corresponding roots companion.
