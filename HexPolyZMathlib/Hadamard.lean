# Hadamard's determinant inequality

This file proves the *sharp* Hadamard determinant inequality over an `RCLike` field: the
norm of the determinant of a square matrix is at most the product of the Euclidean (L²)
norms of its columns.

## Main results

* `Matrix.norm_det_le_prod_norm_column`: for `A : Matrix n n 𝕜` with `[RCLike 𝕜]`,
  `‖A.det‖ ≤ ∏ j, √(∑ i, ‖A i j‖ ^ 2)`, the product of the Euclidean lengths of the columns.

This is genuinely sharper than the entrywise bound {name}`Matrix.det_le`
(which gives the crude `n! · xⁿ` estimate). Equality holds exactly when the columns are
pairwise orthogonal.

The proof is the standard QR / Gram-Schmidt method. Writing the columns as vectors of
`EuclideanSpace 𝕜 n`, the Gram-Schmidt orthonormal basis `e` makes the change-of-basis
matrix upper triangular, so
`e.toBasis.det (columns) = ∏ i, ⟪e i, columns i⟫` (`gramSchmidtOrthonormalBasis_det`).
Each factor is bounded by `‖e i‖ * ‖columns i‖ = ‖columns i‖` by Cauchy-Schwarz, and the
determinant with respect to any orthonormal basis has the same norm as the ordinary matrix
determinant because the change of basis between two orthonormal bases is unitary
({name}`OrthonormalBasis.det_to_matrix_orthonormalBasis`).

This lemma is not currently in Mathlib (only the weak {name}`Matrix.det_le` entrywise bound and
the unrelated {name}`Matrix.IsHadamard` `±1`-matrix theory) and is a natural upstream target. It
is consumed by the real- and complex-root separation developments, where Mahler's
root-separation bound is obtained by applying Hadamard to a Vandermonde matrix.

/-- **Hadamard's inequality** (sharp form). The norm of the determinant of a square matrix
over an `RCLike` field is at most the product of the Euclidean (L²) norms of its columns:
`‖A.det‖ ≤ ∏ j, √(∑ i, ‖A i j‖ ^ 2)`.

This dominates the crude entrywise bound {name}`Matrix.det_le`; equality holds precisely when the
columns are pairwise orthogonal. -/
